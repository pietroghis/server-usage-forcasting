### **Final Roadmap for Deployment Readiness with API Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Define the System Workflow**
1. **Model Training and Baseline Creation**:
   - Train the models (`multi-step`, `multi-model (residual)`, and `single-step`) on historical data.
   - Save each model with appropriate versioning and labeling for clear identification.
     ```python
     model.save("models/multi_step_model_v1", save_format="tf")
     model.save("models/multi_model_residual_v1", save_format="tf")
     model.save("models/single_step_model_v1", save_format="tf")
     ```

2. **Real-Time Prediction**:
   - Deploy the models for real-time predictions via dedicated endpoints.
   - Each model will have a separate endpoint for predictions to ensure clarity and scalability.

3. **Daily Data Integration**:
   - Log input data, predictions, and actual outcomes throughout the day.
   - Aggregate and preprocess the day's data for retraining or fine-tuning.

4. **Model Update**:
   - Retrain or fine-tune each model using the new data.
   - Save and version the updated models for the next day's deployment.
   - Automate the deployment process to switch to the updated models seamlessly.

#### **Step 2: Serialize the Models**
- Save all trained models in TensorFlow's `SavedModel` format for easy loading during API initialization.

---

#### **Step 3: Set Up FastAPI Application with Endpoints**
1. **Train Endpoint**:
   - **Purpose**: Train each model using preloaded datasets in the system.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Trigger the training pipeline for the specified model.
     - Save the trained model and return training metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy).
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     @app.post("/train/{model_name}")
     async def train_model(model_name: str):
         if model_name == "multi_step":
             # Train multi-step model
             model = train_multi_step_model()
             model.save("models/multi_step_model_latest")
         elif model_name == "multi_model_residual":
             # Train residual model
             model = train_residual_model()
             model.save("models/multi_model_residual_latest")
         elif model_name == "single_step":
             # Train single-step model
             model = train_single_step_model()
             model.save("models/single_step_model_latest")
         else:
             return {"error": "Invalid model name"}
         return {"message": f"{model_name} training complete"}
     ```

2. **Predict Endpoint**:
   - **Purpose**: Load the latest version of the specified model and perform predictions on provided input.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Accept JSON input for predictions.
     - Return predictions as a response.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     @app.post("/predict/{model_name}")
     async def predict(model_name: str, features: dict):
         if model_name == "multi_step":
             model = tf.keras.models.load_model("models/multi_step_model_latest")
         elif model_name == "multi_model_residual":
             model = tf.keras.models.load_model("models/multi_model_residual_latest")
         elif model_name == "single_step":
             model = tf.keras.models.load_model("models/single_step_model_latest")
         else:
             return {"error": "Invalid model name"}
         
         data = features["data"]
         predictions = model.predict(data)
         return {"predictions": predictions.tolist()}
     ```

3. **Model Versioning Endpoint**:
   - **Purpose**: Retrieve or update model versions in use.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Return the version of the model currently deployed.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     @app.get("/model_version/{model_name}")
     async def get_model_version(model_name: str):
         # Example: Fetch version from a file or database
         version = get_latest_model_version(model_name)
         return {"model_name": model_name, "version": version}
     ```

4. **Health Check Endpoint**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensure the API is running and all models are loaded correctly.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     @app.get("/health")
     async def health_check():
         return {"status": "API is healthy", "models_loaded": True}
     ```

5. **Log Retrieval Endpoint**:
   - **Purpose**: Retrieve logs for debugging or performance analysis.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     @app.get("/logs")
     async def get_logs():
         # Retrieve logs from file or database
         logs = fetch_logs()
         return {"logs": logs}
     ```

---

#### **Step 4: Automate Daily Workflow**
1. **Logging**:
   - Set up a mechanism to log:
     - Input data received by the API.
     - Predictions made by the models.
     - Ground truth outcomes (if available).

2. **Model Retraining**:
   - Automate the retraining of each model using the dayâ€™s aggregated data.
   - Save the updated models and deploy them automatically at the start of the next day.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Use Docker and Kubernetes for deploying the FastAPI app and handling scaling or updates.
